# Color-Memory-Effect-Experiment
PsychoPy experiment files for the 'How Color Affects Memory' research project for my course "Experimental Research in Psychology".

This repository contains the experimental design materials for a experimental psychology research project conducted at the **University of Wrocław** (Erasmus+ Program, Winter 2025-2026).

## Introduction
Does the background color influence our ability to memorize words? This study investigates the **"Color Priming"** effect—specifically, whether warm colors (e.g., Red) vs. cool colors (e.g., Blue) act as contextual cues that enhance or impair memory retention. Based on literature (Wilcox et al., 2014; Bargh & Lian, 2020), we hypothesized that color serves as an attentional orienting cue, potentially modulating memory encoding through emotional and semantic associations.

## Methodology
* **Participants:** 18 participants between the age of 18-25.
* **Procedure:** Participants were exposed to colored backgrounds (Red vs. Blue vs. Neutral) and a series of words were presented. Then, a short task to prevent rehearsal. Participants were asked to recognize/recall the words. This experiment was designed in **PsychoPy**.

## Tools
* **PsychoPy (Builder):** Used to construct the experiment flow, randomize stimuli presentation, and record reaction times.
* **JAMOVI:** Used for statistical analysis (Descriptive Statistics, t-tests) to interpret the aggregated data.

## Repository Contents
* `Experiment_Color_Memory.psyexp`: The main **PsychoPy** source file. Open this to view the logic, loops, and conditions.
* `Report.pdf`: The full academic report detailing the literature review, methodology, and discussion.

## Key Findings
* The study explored how chromatic priming (e.g., Red linked to urgency vs. Blue linked to calmness) might affect attentional resources.
* While previous studies suggest warm colors enhance focused memory, our results showed that there were no significant difference.
